## Bosch Hackathon Project Description

### Challenge Overview

This project was developed as part of the Bosch hackathon, which focused on utilizing the front video camera sensor. The challenge involved two main objectives:

1. **Object Filtering and Scenario Identification**: The first part required filtering out unnecessary target objects and identifying the correct scenario (scenarios listed in the second part of the challenge).

2. **Measurement and Visualization**: The team had to measure the longitudinal and lateral distance of the relevant object from the vehicle, along with its speed. Using this information, they were tasked with creating a visual representation of the vehicle's environment, including the movement of both the vehicle and the target object.

### Expectations

The goal was to present a comprehensive visualization encompassing all aspects of motion and environment. This visualization was implemented using various technologies and tools, such as Python scripts, .NET applications, MangoDB, JavaScript, Jupyter notebook.

### Key Tasks and Objectives

- Based on the available data, the team was required to create a dynamic visualization illustrating the movement of the vehicle and the relevant object, as well as the complete environment.

- The team was tasked with implementing a filtering mechanism to remove unnecessary target objects. Additionally, they were required to calculate the speed of both the vehicle and the target object at various timestamps.

- Longitudinal and lateral distances between the vehicle and the relevant object were to be accurately measured and incorporated into the visualization.

### Implementation Details

The project leveraged the front video camera sensor data to achieve the specified objectives. The team employed to process and analyze the data.
